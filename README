This repo has all my practice programs

range.coffee : In this program users are asked to input commands either:
insert <location (int)> <number_of_times (int)> <value (char)> OR
range or range <From (int)> <number_of_places (int)>

insert - 
    This command takes two integer arguments and  places the char in location position number_of_times times in a array

range -
    This command displays the array
